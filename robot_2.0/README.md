This is my second attempt at a robot in c++

Dependancies:
boost

The robot will:
Sense distance with sonar and electromagnetic distance sensor
Sense temperature.
Move all directions.
Navigate via gps module.
Run a server that can accept incomming commands to control the robot

Experimentally this will attempt to learn how to do simple task.
